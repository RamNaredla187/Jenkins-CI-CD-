# Jenkins-CI-CD-
# Work flow of CI/CD
- CI/CD (Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment) is used to automate and streamline the process of software development, testing, and delivery
### Let me explain the scenario of how CI/CD (Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment) works in a real-world software development pipeline.
# Scenario: A Web Application Development Process
- Imagine you're part of a development team working on a web application. The team consists of multiple developers, testers, and operations staff. Without CI/CD, each of these roles might handle parts of the development, testing, and deployment manually, resulting in slower development cycles, higher risk of bugs, and inconsistent deployments.

- However, by implementing CI/CD, the process becomes automated, faster, and more reliable.
## Step-by-Step CI/CD Scenario
#### 1. Developer Makes Changes (Code Commit)
- A developer works on a new feature or fixes a bug in the code. Once they’ve completed their work, they commit their changes to a version control system (like Git).<br>
- CI (Continuous Integration) kicks in once the commit is pushed to the repository (e.g., GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket). The system detects that new code has been added.
#### 2. Continuous Integration (CI) – Build and Test
`Automated Build`: The CI pipeline is triggered. It starts by pulling the latest code and running a build process (compiling, packaging, etc.) to ensure the new code integrates smoothly with the rest of the project.<br>
`Automated Testing`: After the build, automated tests (unit tests, integration tests, etc.) are executed to verify that the new code doesn’t break existing functionality and that it meets the expected behavior.<br>
- If tests pass, the pipeline proceeds to the next step.<br>
- If any test fails, the developer is notified immediately, and they can fix the issue before it progresses further.
#### 3. Continuous Deployment (CD) – Staging Environment
- Once the build passes all tests, Continuous Deployment can automatically deploy the code to a staging environment (a replica of the production environment).<br>
- The staging environment is used to simulate real-world usage and test if the application behaves as expected before going live.<br>
- Automated Functional Tests might also run in staging, including UI tests or load tests, to simulate user interactions and check performance under stress.
#### 4. Approval (Optional) – Manual Review in Some Cases
- Depending on your CI/CD setup, a manual approval step might be needed before the code is deployed to production. For example, a product manager or lead developer might review the changes in staging to verify everything looks good.<br>
- However, in many modern pipelines, this step can be skipped for smaller updates, allowing faster, automated deployment.
#### 5. Continuous Deployment (CD) – Production Deployment
- If everything looks good in staging, the code can be automatically deployed to production, making it available to end users.<br>
- This step happens without any human intervention, ensuring that the latest changes are delivered quickly and reliably.
#### 6. Monitoring and Feedback
- After deployment, automated monitoring systems keep track of the application's health in the production environment. If any issues are detected (e.g., crashes, performance degradation, etc.), alerts are triggered.<br>
- These alerts help the team respond quickly, with the ability to roll back to a previous stable version if needed.<br>
- The development team continuously receives feedback through monitoring tools, ensuring that any new bug or issue is identified early.
#### 7. Continuous Improvement
- As more changes are made by developers, the CI/CD pipeline continues to run the same steps: building, testing, and deploying automatically.<br>
- This creates a feedback loop where development, testing, and deployment are constantly optimized and improved.
## Benefits using CI/CD
`Speed`: The process from code commit to deployment is automated, allowing features or fixes to reach production quickly.<br>
`Reliability`: Automated tests and checks ensure that the new code doesn't break the application or introduce bugs.<br>
`Consistency`: The same pipeline (build, test, deploy) is applied every time, leading to predictable and repeatable releases.<br>
`Reduced Risk`: Since testing occurs in each stage, issues are caught early, reducing the risk of a major failure in production.<br>
`Faster Feedback`: Developers get immediate feedback on the quality of their changes, helping them to address problems faster.
